# Contracts ðŸ§ª

This repository contains the smart contracts for my DofE project.

## Features 
- CI/CD for pull requests and commits.
- `VaultFactory.sol` contract
- `Vault.sol` contract
- Documentation
- Deploy script

most of the codebase can be found at [src](/src)

## What I have achieved 

- Improved solidity skills generally 
- Accomplished primary objective: write the fractionalization protocol
- Learnt about various optimization techniques
- Learnt to use the [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) testing framework
- Learnt about token standards
- Learnt about various best practices, like the 'factory' pattern, as well as potential common security pitfalls 

## Further improvements

- Finish writing tests - currently fail and are not as extensive as i would like them to be
- Optimize function call cost and layout in memory
- Clarify contract states - eg. auction over, auction on / off

## Deployments
